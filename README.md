# Different lists can be made!

When we first open the link we are taken to the main list. From there, we can navigate to and create other lists as well!
Just add the name of the desired list to the end of the URL like this -> URL+"/new" .
If this list exists then we will be taken to this list otherwise a new list will be created on the web with this name.
